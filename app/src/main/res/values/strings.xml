        <item>Gross feeding damage to foliage, growing points, and young stems. Severe infestation results in total defoliation or destruction of the plant to ground level. Eggs: Pale-yellowish and becomes dark brown just before hatching. The black head-capsules of the larvae can be seen through the shells. Each egg is about 0.5 mm in diameter, conical with a slightly rounded apex and a densely sculpted surface; Larvae: Develops from grey-green with white-yellow stripes down its back when small, to black with thin blue lines down the middle of the back and yellow-green lines outside the blue lines when fully grown. It measures 2 to 3cm long, has a velvety-black upper surface with pale lateral lines, a green or yellow ventral surface, and no hairs on the body. There are three parallel lines on the dorsal surface of the prothoracic (first body) segment and a stripe running longitudinally down the mid-dorsal surface of the body is always paler than the black pigmentation on either side of it. The head is always shiny-black; Pupa: Mahogany-brown, 10-14mm long, with a smooth, shiny surface; Adult: It is 14-18mm long and has a 29-32mm wing span. The abdomen is covered with pale grey-brown scales (except for the tip in the female which has black hair-scales). Forewings are dark-brown with distinctive grey-black markings. Hindwings are white with dark veins.</item>
        <item>Many animals, birds and insects prey on the African armyworm at different stages of its life cycle. These natural enemies should be encouraged by maintaining natural surroundings with plenty of breeding places for them, including trees and shrubs. Night birds and bats feed on the African armyworm moths, and lacewings, wasps, parasitic wasps and spiders eat the caterpillars; Avoid burning and overgrazing of grasslands which are the natural habitat and food store of the caterpillars. Burning often causes outbreaks because as soon as temperatures rise, eggs are laid in large quantities on the fresh new grass.</item>

        <item>Seedbeds should be established far from large areas of weeds, remove weeds from areas outside of fields, and plow all uncultivated land. In insecticides, sprays are more effective than granules. High dosages are required to kill large armyworm and cutworm larvae. Spraying should be done late in the afternoon before the larvae leave their resting places to climb up the plants. Because damage is normally concentrated in discrete areas of a rice field, only areas where damage occurs should be sprayed.</item>

        <item>Cnaphalocrocis medinalis (Guenée)</item>
        <item>The first sign of leaffolder infestation is the presence of moths in the field. Longitudinal and transparent whitish streaks on damaged leaves, tubular folded leaves, and leaf tips sometimes fastened to the basal part of leaf are caused by larvae feeding. Severely damaged plants appear burned with many folded leaves. Under heavy attack, a field will appear gray white from a distance. Eggs: Translucent, yellowish white, oval, 0.90 mm long and 0.39 mm wide, and almost flat with a slightly convex surface; Larva: Young larvae are translucent but turn yellowish green as they mature, head capsules and thoraxes are brown, have one pair of dark spots on the abdomen near the head; Pupa: Light brown, but turns reddish brown toward moth emergence; Adult: 10-12mm long and has wing span of 13-15mm; light brown with shiny, brownish yellow wings adorned with dark, broad margins, and two to three dark vertical stripes; appears triangular when at rest.</item>
        <item>Careful use of nitrogenous fertilizer in split applications is recommended. Removal of grassy weeds from rice fields and surrounding borders prevents the buildup of rice leaffolders on alternate hosts. However, chemical control is the only practical method to control increasing leaffolder infestation during crop growth. Numerous insecticides that have been identified for control are most effective as foliar sprays. But foliar sprays have to be repeated because they are often washed off by frequent rains. Granular insecticides broadcast into water are ineffective. Since leaffolders can attack the crop during any growth stage, fields should be monitored weekly.</item>

        <item>Bacterial Leaf Blight</item>
        <item></item>
        <item>Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae</item>
        <item>Symptoms appear first as water-soaked stripes at the margin of fully developed leaves. Lesions enlarge both in length and width. Margins are wavy and turn light brown in a few days. Regions adjoining the healthy part has a water-soaked appearance. Lesions may start at one or both edges of the leaves and as the disease advances, the lesions cover the entire blade, turn grayish, and later white. Appearance of milky or ”opaque dew drops” on the surface of young lesions in the morning is a sign of bacterial blight infection. The milky dew drops dry to form small, amber-colored beads and these spheres are the ooze of the bacterial mass. Infection at seedling stage develop “Kresek” or wilting of whole leaves or the entire plant. It causes wilting of seedlings and yellowing and drying of leaves.</item>
        <item>Use of resistant varieties together with modified cultural practices to disrupt the disease cycle and proper deployment of resistant varieties in the field. Use balanced amounts of plant nutrients, especially nitrogen. Keep fields clean. Remove weed hosts and plow under rice stubble, straw, rice ratoons and volunteer seedlings, which can serve as hosts of bacteria.</item>

        <item></item>
        <item>Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola</item>
        <item>Infected plants show browning and drying of leaves. Initially appear as small, water-soaked, linear lesions between leaf veins. These streaks are initially dark green and later become light brown to yellowish gray. The lesions are translucent when held against the light. Entire leaves may become brown and die when the disease is very severe. Infected plants show browning and drying of leaves. Under severe conditions, this could lead to reduced grain weight due to loss of photosynthetic area.</item>
        <item>Use of resistant to the disease varieties of rice. Treat seeds with hot water. Keep fields clean—remove weed hosts and plow under rice stubble, straw, rice ratoons, and volunteer seedlings, which may be infected by the bacteria. Use balanced amounts of plant nutrients, especially nitrogen.</item>

        <item>Mycelia present on the nodes of infected plants are signs of the pathogen, Infected plants become yellow and begin to wilt at later stages. Infected seedlings are easily identified in the field because they are relatively taller, spindly and pale compared to the healthy seedlings</item>
        <item>Use of Resistant varieties, Seed treatment with recommended fungicides, Gather and burn infected plants or deep plowing to bury and submerge infected stubbles can help reduce sources of inocula.</item>

        <item>Brown Spot</item>
        <item>Helminthosporium oryzae/Cochliobolus miyabeanus</item>
        <item>On leaves, the spots vary in size and shape from minute dots to circular or oval spots. Similar symptoms can be observed on the leaf sheath of the infected plant, Smaller spots are dark brown or purplish brown. Larger ones have the same color at the edge but maybe pale yellow, dirty white, brown or gray towards the center, Spots may coalesce so that the entire leaf surface withers and dries up. Brown spot is a fungal disease that infects the coleoptile, leaves, leaf sheath, panicle branches, glumes, and spikelets. Its most observable damage are the numerous big spots on the leaves which can kill the whole leaf. When infection occurs in the seed, unfilled grains or spotted or discolored seeds are formed.</item>
        <item>Plant resistant varieties, Use only healthy or clean seeds for planting or treat seeds with recommended fungicides if necessary, Apply muriate of potash to correct the soil deficiency, Spray with recommended fungicides.</item>

        <item>Puccinia polysora</item>
        <item>Surfaces of leaf blades, leaf sheaths and stalks exhibit brown, circular, powdery pustules. Leaves which are severely infected dries up and defoliates prematurely. Those of southern rust are circular to oval, light cinnamon-brown to orange in color and predominantly on the upper-leaf surface. Pustules tend to occur only sparsely on the leaf underside, but may occur abundantly on the leaf sheath. Haloes can be observed in some hybrids around pustules when leaves are backlit. The pustules are usually more densely clustered than those of common rust. And, like common rust, the pustules can darken in color later in the season as the spore type changes. Common corn rust, caused by the fungus Puccinia sorghi, is the most frequently occurring of the two primary rust diseases of corn in the U.S., but it rarely causes significant yield losses in Ohio field (dent) corn. Occasionally field corn, particularly in the southern half of the state, does become severely affected when weather conditions favor the development and spread of the rust fungus. Sweet corn is generally more susceptible than field corn. In years with exceptionally cool summers, and especially on late-planted fields or sweet corn, yield losses may occur when the leaves at and above the ears become severely diseased before grain fill is complete.</item>
        <item>Plow deep to bury scleotia. Some producers avoid disease or minimize its effects by not planting late or by using shorter season hybrids. By doing so, they have a more mature and resistant crop in the field when rust spores arrive and sometimes disease can be completely avoided.</item>

        <item>Galls or boil on aboveground tissues. Galls first appear as glistening white or grayish white swellings. Interior of galls later becomes black and powdery and ontains numerous sooty masses of spores. Common smut, a disease that occurs wherever corn is grown, is caused by Ustilago maydis, a fungus that survives on crop debris and on the soil. It can infect any tissue of the plant by entering through wounds and forming characteristic smut galls. The fungus can also enter through the silks, causing gall formation on the ear tip. Yield is reduced because of impaired plant function and even barrenness.</item>
