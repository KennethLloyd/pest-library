        <item>Gross feeding damage to foliage, growing points, and young stems. Severe infestation results in total defoliation or destruction of the plant to ground level. Eggs: Pale-yellowish and becomes dark brown just before hatching. The black head-capsules of the larvae can be seen through the shells. Each egg is about 0.5 mm in diameter, conical with a slightly rounded apex and a densely sculpted surface; Larvae: Develops from grey-green with white-yellow stripes down its back when small, to black with thin blue lines down the middle of the back and yellow-green lines outside the blue lines when fully grown. It measures 2 to 3cm long, has a velvety-black upper surface with pale lateral lines, a green or yellow ventral surface, and no hairs on the body. There are three parallel lines on the dorsal surface of the prothoracic (first body) segment and a stripe running longitudinally down the mid-dorsal surface of the body is always paler than the black pigmentation on either side of it. The head is always shiny-black; Pupa: Mahogany-brown, 10-14mm long, with a smooth, shiny surface; Adult: It is 14-18mm long and has a 29-32mm wing span. The abdomen is covered with pale grey-brown scales (except for the tip in the female which has black hair-scales). Forewings are dark-brown with distinctive grey-black markings. Hindwings are white with dark veins.</item>
        <item>Many animals, birds and insects prey on the African armyworm at different stages of its life cycle. These natural enemies should be encouraged by maintaining natural surroundings with plenty of breeding places for them, including trees and shrubs. Night birds and bats feed on the African armyworm moths, and lacewings, wasps, parasitic wasps and spiders eat the caterpillars; Avoid burning and overgrazing of grasslands which are the natural habitat and food store of the caterpillars. Burning often causes outbreaks because as soon as temperatures rise, eggs are laid in large quantities on the fresh new grass.</item>

        <item>Cnaphalocrocis medinalis (Guenée)</item>
        <item>The first sign of leaffolder infestation is the presence of moths in the field. Longitudinal and transparent whitish streaks on damaged leaves, tubular folded leaves, and leaf tips sometimes fastened to the basal part of leaf are caused by larvae feeding. Severely damaged plants appear burned with many folded leaves. Under heavy attack, a field will appear gray white from a distance. Eggs: Translucent, yellowish white, oval, 0.90 mm long and 0.39 mm wide, and almost flat with a slightly convex surface; Larva: Young larvae are translucent but turn yellowish green as they mature, head capsules and thoraxes are brown, have one pair of dark spots on the abdomen near the head; Pupa: Light brown, but turns reddish brown toward moth emergence; Adult: 10-12mm long and has wing span of 13-15mm; light brown with shiny, brownish yellow wings adorned with dark, broad margins, and two to three dark vertical stripes; appears triangular when at rest.</item>
        <item>Careful use of nitrogenous fertilizer in split applications is recommended. Removal of grassy weeds from rice fields and surrounding borders prevents the buildup of rice leaffolders on alternate hosts. However, chemical control is the only practical method to control increasing leaffolder infestation during crop growth. Numerous insecticides that have been identified for control are most effective as foliar sprays. But foliar sprays have to be repeated because they are often washed off by frequent rains. Granular insecticides broadcast into water are ineffective. Since leaffolders can attack the crop during any growth stage, fields should be monitored weekly.</item>

        <item>Pentalonia nigronervosa</item>
        <item>Like most aphids, the banana aphid is a phloem feeder that uses its long stylets to pierce plant tissues to suck the sap directly from the vessels. This can cause plants to become deformed; the leaves become curled and shriveled, and in some cases galls are formed on the leaves. Nymphs: Like most other aphid species, the banana aphid has four nymphal stages. Newborn nymphs are oval at first and become slightly elongated. They are reddish brown, with four segmented antennae, and measure 1/250 inch in length. The second stage nymphs are similar in appearance and measure approximately 7/250 inch long. The third nymphal stage individuals are light brown, measuring about 9/250 inch in length; the compound eyes are more noticeable beginning with this stage, and the nymphs have five-segmented antennae. The fourth stage nymphs have six-segmented antennae, are light brown in color, and are 1/25 inch long. The first, second, third, and fourth nymphal stages last 2 to 4, 3 to 4, 2 to 4, and 2 to 4 days, respectively. Adults: Adult banana aphids are small to medium sized aphids (1/25 to 1/12 inch), shiny, reddish to dark brown or almost black. They have six-segmented antennae that are as long as the body. Alates have prominent, dark (brown or black) wing veins. Adults start producing young one day after reaching maturity. They can give birth to 4 aphids per day with an average production of 14 offspring per female.</item>
        <item>Aphids can be killed by their natural enemies, or with sprays of registered insecticides, or with insecticidal soaps or liquid dish washing detergents and vegetable oils. Ants protect the aphids from their enemies, and ants feed upon the sweet honeydew that aphids produce. Control tips: (1) Inspect alternate hosts for aphids - eliminate populations of banana aphids that are living on non-banana hosts within the vicinity of your bananas; (2) Inspect banana plants for aphids - scout banana plants at least twice per month for aphid colonies; (3) Control ants - control ants if possible and lawful, ants aggressively protect aphids from natural enemies; (4) Invite beneficial animals and insects - strive to foster a conducive environment for beneficial, aphid-feeding or -parasitizing insects such as lady beetles; (5) Destroy wild bananas in the area - eliminate wild of unattended patches of bananas, large populations of banana aphids can grow on them and the wild patches when infected can serve as a serious and constant source of disease for farms and residential neighborhoods; (6) Control weeds around bananas - maintain good weed control around the banana patch; (7) Diversify the banana farm - grow a range of different plants or crops; (8) Prune the mats - keep banana mats pruned of all unwanted suckers; (9) Spray for aphid control.</item>

        <item>Leaves have abnormal colours, abnormal leaf fall, internal feeding, necrotic areas, and wilting. Adult lace bugs have beautifully sculptured wings that resemble an intricate, lacy network. There are also lacy extensions at each side on the front part of the body and an expanded, lacy hood that extends over the head. Some species are almost entirely white while others are marked with black or brown. They range in size from 1/8 to 3/16 inch. Nymphs do not have wings but usually have spines on the back.</item>
        <item>To manage lace bugs, remove leaflets harboring the insects and destroy them. For chemical method, spraying one these can help: Malathion 50 EC @ 2 ml/lt, Dimethoate 30 EC @1 ml/lt, Methyl demeton 25 EC @1 ml/lt, Phosphamidon 40 SL @1.25 ml/lt, Monocrotophos 36 WSC @1 ml/lt, Methomyl 25 EC @2 ml/lit, 3% Neem oil.</item>

        <item>Chrysomphalus aonidium Hemiberlesia lataneae</item>
        <item>Whether armored or soft, scale insects are often found on the undersides of leaves or on branches. Each species of scale has specific plants they are associated with. The scale blends in well, so the actual insect may not be very apparent. When scales feed underneath the leaves, yellow spots often appear on the tops of the foliage. Over time, the plant can become more chlorotic-looking, and new plant growth can be stunted. And if you’re dealing with soft scale, another symptom is the appearance of sooty mold. (Be aware, however, that sooty mold can also be caused by whiteflies and aphids.) Scale insects vary dramatically in appearance; from very small organisms (1–2 mm) that grow beneath wax covers (some shaped like oyster shells, others like mussel shells), to shiny pearl-like objects (about 5 mm), to creatures covered with mealy wax. Adult female scales are almost always immobile (aside from mealybugs) and permanently attached to the plant they have parasitized. They secrete a waxycoating for defense; this coating causes them to resemble reptilian scales or fish scales, hence their common name.</item>
        <item>To get rid of scale insects prune and dispose of infested branches, twigs and leaves. When scale numbers are low they may be rubbed or picked off of plants by hand. Dabbing individual pests with an alcohol-soaked cotton swab or neem-based leaf shine will also work when infestations are light. Commercially available beneficial insects, such as ladybugs and lacewing, are natural predators of the young larval or “crawler” stage. Organic pesticides, like insecticidal soap and d-Limonene can also be used to kill the larvae. However, these products have very little persistence in the environment, so several applications during egg-hatching will be required for effective control. Azamax contains azadirachtin, the key insecticidal ingredient found in neem oil. This concentrated spray is approved for organic use and offers multiple modes of action, making it virtually impossible for pest resistance to develop. Best of all, it’s non-toxic to honey bees and many other beneficial insects. Horticultural oils and other safe, oil-based insecticides work by smothering insects and will control all pest stages, including adults which are protected from most other insecticides by their armor coverings. Fast-acting botanical insecticides should be used as a last resort. Derived from plants which have insecticidal properties, these natural pesticides have fewer harmful side effects than synthetic chemicals and break down more quickly in the environment.</item>

        <item>Due to their small sizes and high rates of reproduction, thrips are difficult to control using classical biological control. All predators must be small and slender enough to penetrate the crevices where thrips hide while feeding, and then prey extensively on eggs and larvae. Only two families of parasitoid Hymenoptera are known to parasitize eggs and larvae, the Eulophidae and the Trichogrammatidae. Other biocontrol agents of adults and larvae include aphid wasps, anthocorid bugs of genus Orius, and phytoseiid mites. For this reason, many growers are occasionally forced to make limited use of pesticides to control thrips populations in the field and in greenhouses. Another effective strategy for pest thrips are biological insecticides, including Beauveria bassiana or Verticillium lecanii. These demonstrate a clear effect on eggs, larvae and adults of thrips. Insecticidal soap spray is effective against thrips. It is commercially available or can be made of certain types of household soap. Scientists in Japan report that significant reductions in larva and adult melon thripes occur when plants are illuminated with red light.</item>

        <item>Conopomorpha cramerella</item>
        <item>External damage to the pod caused by the cocoa pod borer is seen as entry and exit holes created by the tunnelling larvae on the husk, and overall premature or uneven ripening (yellowing) of pods caused by internal feeding activity. If pods are cut open, characteristic tunnels and scarification caused by feeding commonly cause beans to stick together. Harvested beans clump together in severe infestations and may be impossible to extract from damaged pods. Adult: The adult is a small brown moth, ca 7 mm in length. It has a wingspan of about 12 mm characterized by bright yellow patches at the tips of the forewings. The moths have very long antennae which are swept backwards in their natural resting position. Moths in flight have an appearance similar to that of large, slow-flying mosquitoes. Eggs: Eggs are yellow-orange, flattened and just visible to the naked eye (ca 0.5 x 0.2 mm). Rectangular indentations cover the surface of the egg. On hatching, eggs become translucent, the shell being whitish but darkened by faeces within. Larva: First-instar larvae are translucent white in colour and ca 1 mm long. Late-instar larvae are ca 10 mm long and creamy coloured while still inside the pod, but greenish after they emerge to pupate. Pupa: Pupae lie beneath a light-brown waterproof silken membrane tightly drawn over a depression on a pod surface or leaf.</item>
        <item>Harvesting: Rampasan; Mechanical control: Sleeving; Integrated Pest Management: The most immediate reductions in C. cramerella are likely to come about through better managed harvesting and spraying. Both of these rely on well-pruned trees kept to a height low enough to collect and/or spray all pods. See sections on Harvesting (Rampasan) and Chemical Control. Longer term control may be improved by grafting or replanting with hard-walled clones. Further releases of exotic natural enemies may provide additional partial control, if suitable parasites can be found.</item>

        <item>Growing point: distortion; Inflorescence: twisting and distortion; Leaves: abnormal forms, leaves rolled or folded. Eggs are not produced by this species. Females give birth to living young. There are four nymphal stages of this aphid. The first stage is approximately 1/36 inch in length and the last about 1/17 inch. They are without wings and brownish in color. Only females are found. They are oval, shiny black, brownish-black or reddish brown in color, either with or without wings, measuring 1/25 to 1/12 inch in body length and having short black-and-white banded antennae. Winged individuals tend to have darker abdomens and be slightly thinner. The incidence of winged individuals is dependent on the population density and leaf age. Reproduction is partheneogenic or non sexual. Females start reproducing soon after becoming adults. They produce 5 to 7 live young per day, up to a total of about 50 young per female.</item>
        <item>Non-Chemical Control: Several natural enemies of the black citrus aphid keep this pest under control. Sometimes to the extent that insecticides are usually unnecessary; Chemical Control: If chemical control becomes necessary either insecticidal oil, or a synthetic aphidicide(insecticide) may be used. Chemical control should only be applied at the first signs of damage during periods of flush growth. Flush growth (young red leaves) on coffee should be completely moistened after application of chemicals.</item>

        <item>Chemical control: Direct insecticidal sprays to lower leaf surfaces and new growth to give thorough coverage; Biological control: Several entomogenous fungi were observed associated with green scale on citrus, and some apparently played an important role in the natural limitations of the scale on citrus during certain seasons of the year. In Florida, these fungi include: the white-fringed fungus, Verticilium (Cephalosporium ) lecanii (Zimmerman); Aschersonia cubensis (Cuban aschersonia); the pink scale fungus, Nectria diploa; and a grayish blue fungus The white-fringed fungus is the most common and apparently causes the highest percentage of mortality. All attempts to artificially spread or inoculate the fungus to healthy green scale were unsuccessful. The green scale is often associated with ants. Controlling ant populations help to reduce levels of this pest. Ants protect the green scales from lady beetles and other predators. In turn, the ants feed on the sweet honeydew excreted by the scales. Without the ants the green scale is more vulnerable to predation by beetles; Cultural Control: Scales are usually brought into greenhouse situations with the introduction of infested plant material. All plant material going into the greenhouse should be thoroughly inspected for scales and other insects before being introduced.</item>

Regions adjoining the healthy part has a water-soaked appearance. Lesions may start at one or both edges of the leaves and as the disease advances, the lesions cover the entire blade, turn grayish, and later white. Appearance of milky or ”opaque dew drops” on the surface of young lesions in the morning is a sign of bacterial blight infection. The milky dew drops dry to form small, amber-colored beads and these spheres are the ooze of the bacterial mass. Infection at seedling stage develop “Kresek” or wilting of whole leaves or the entire plant. It causes wilting of seedlings and yellowing and drying of leaves.</item>

        <item>Surfaces of leaf blades, leaf sheaths and stalks exhibit brown, circular, powdery pustules. Leaves which are severely infected dries up and defoliates prematurely. Those of southern rust are circular to oval, light cinnamon-brown to orange in color and predominantly on the upper-leaf surface. Pustules tend to occur only sparsely on the leaf underside, but may occur abundantly on the leaf sheath. Haloes can be observed in some hybrids around pustules when leaves are backlit. The pustules are usually more densely clustered than those of common rust. And, like common rust, the pustules can darken in color later in the season as the spore type changes. Common corn rust, caused by the fungus Puccinia sorghi, is the most frequently occurring of the two primary rust diseases of corn in the U.S., but it rarely causes significant yield losses in Ohio field (dent) corn. Occasionally field corn, particularly in the southern half of the state, does become severely affected when weather conditions favor the development and spread of the rust fungus. Sweet corn is generally more susceptible than field corn. In years with exceptionally cool summers, and especially on late-planted fields or sweet corn, yield losses may occur when the leaves at and above the ears become severely diseased before grain fill is complete.</item>
        <item>Plow deep to bury scleotia. Some producers avoid disease or minimize its effects by not planting late or by using shorter season hybrids. By doing so, they have a more mature and resistant crop in the field when rust spores arrive and sometimes disease can be completely avoided.</item>

This is caused by the fungal structures protruding through the surface of the leaf. Both the large and small spots are dark brown to black in colour. The small spots are less than 1mm in diameter and appear sooty. They can run together to form streaks. The larger spots are up to 4mm in diameter and can also appear as streaks. Sometimes the centre of these larger spots are lighter in colour. Spots can also appear on the midrib of the leaf and on the petioles.</item>

        <item>Symptoms vary depending on the strain of the virus, the variety of banana or plantain and the environment. The most common symptom is lines of yellow that run from the midrib of the leaf to the margin. These streaks are continuous or broken, and either scattered throughout the leaf or in bands. As the leaf ages, the streaks turn brown or black. Initially, the symptoms are similar to Cucumber mosaic virus.Infected plants may be smaller than normal and less vigorous, with smaller bunches. In some African countries, dieback and internal rotting of the pseudostem occurs. Differences between symptoms in different parts of the world led to them being described as distinct viruses. Molecular studies on the DNA of the viruses have confirmed the differences. Spread of the virus is in planting material, suckers primarily. Spread can also occur as plants in tissue culture if they are not tested properly. It is now known that the virus or parts of the virus can enter the DNA of certain varieties (e.g., AAB, ABB, AAAB types) and remain hidden there without showing symptoms. However, if bananas are grown under stress, such as occurs when they are growing as tissue cultures, the virus reassembles, multiplies, and symptoms appear. Spread between plants is by mealybugs, especially species of Planococcus and Pseudococcus, although how important they are is not well known.</item>

        <item>Plants with banana bunchy top (BBT) have narrow, progressively shorter leaves with little distance between them, hence the name "bunchy top". Leaf edges often roll upwards with yellow margins. The most characteristic symptoms are short, dark-green dots and dashes along the minor leaf veins, so-called "Morse-code" patterns, which form hooks curving downwards near the edge of the midrib. Hold the leaf up to the light and view from the underside. The virus is spread by an aphid, Pentalonia nigronervosa. It takes more than 4 hours of feeding on a diseased plant before aphids become infected with the virus. But once infected, the aphids continue spreading the virus until they die. Aphids live for 15-20 days. The virus is not transmitted on tools or through the soil. BBT is caused by a virus. In the past, the disease has devastated banana industries in Australia, Fiji, Samoa and Tonga. Today, it is causing much damage in Pakistan and is spreading in the DR Congo. Plants that are infected when young rarely produce a fruit bunch. When diseased suckers are planted they become severely stunted and they do not produce fruit. Plants infected at a later growth stage may produce a distorted bunch. In Pacific island countries, the failure to select healthy planting material has resulted in plantations showing 20% of plants with BBT in the first year, and major losses within 2-3 years.</item>
        <item>Banana plants should only be transferred between countries as tissue cultures tested to ensure that they are free of all known banana viruses.

        <item>Cultural control: Several cultural practices to manage black pod disease could be implemented in cocoa plantation. A spacing of 3.1 x 3.1m and pruning of trees are recommended for cocoa planting in order to allow more light and air flow around the trees. This will reduce the level of humidity that is causing black pod disease. The removal of pods with black pod symptom should also be done in favor to eliminate the source of inoculum. In another study, the utilization of litter mulch under cocoa plantation has been reported in Papua New Guinea, which has some negative effect on the population of P. palmivora, and therefore could reduce the pod infection especially at the beginning of raining season. Leaf litter showed rapid decline in pathogen recovery of colonized cocoa tissue after 18 weeks, relative to grass ground cover. More frequent ripe pod harvest (i.e. twice a week) and removal of infected pod on the ground was demonstrated to significantly reduced disease occurrence and improve pod yield compared to less frequent harvest and removal (i.e. once a month). In addition, scattered healthy pod on the ground should also be removed, as it will be infected and become the source of inoculum later. Sanitation is one cultural method to control for black pod disease. Sanitation practices include weed removal, pruning, thinning and removal of infected and mummified pods every two weeks in order to eliminate the source for inoculum. Phytosanitary pod removal was observed to significantly reduce disease occurrences by 9–11% to 22–31%, where this practice removes the source for secondary inoculum. However, increase in disease incidence after raining season was observed to be most likely due to the spread of inoculum from survival site by the rain. The application of fungicide following sanitation is commonly performed for an effective control of disease, as sanitation practice alone would not completely eliminate the source of inoculum and still causes greater black pod incident compared to sanitation followed by at least one fungicide application; Chemical control: The application of copper fungicide has been shown to significantly reduce a great number of black pod incidences in Nigeria. Metalaxyl (Ridomil) and cuprous oxide (Perenox) were identified to be successful in increasing the number of harvested healthy pod compared to the application of fosetyl aluminium (Aliete) and control treatment. On top of that, the timing of fungicide application has some positive effect on the final pod yield where this plot produced greater yield than the unsprayed plot. The application was done before August, which is before the main disease epidemic that usually occurs in September and October. The recommended standard for fungicide application to control black pod disease caused by P. megakarya for a season is 6 to 8 times of application in every 3–4 weeks. However, the adoption of recommended application was very low among farmers in Ghana. Therefore, an experiment with a reduced number of fungicide applications demonstrated that there was 25 to 45% reduction in disease incidence. In terms of disease control and yields, sanitation and three applications of Ridomil 72 plus (12% metalaxyl + 60% copper-1-oxide) fungicide showed a better control compared to sanitation alone and sanitation with one or two fungicide applications. However, reduced in fungicide application was shown to be significantly less effective than the recommended standard fungicide application. It was suggested that the understanding regarding the source of inoculum, the amount of infective inoculum production and how the disease is disseminated is important in order to identify the appropriate and economical method in fungicide application as well as for an effective control of the disease. For example, the application of fungicide on the trunk will help farmers to control the spread of the disease up in the canopy, as it is difficult to reach the canopy during fungicide application. This will eventually save more time, labor and cost for disease management; Cultural and chemical control: In Ghana, a study that combined the sanitation and fungicide application showed a significant reduction in the percentage of disease incidence, where greater black pod incident were observed from pods on the trunk than the canopy in control treatment (no fungicide application). This suggested that the application of fungicide on the trunk would protect pods from infection, therefore reduce primary and secondary infection rate, both on the trunk and in the canopy. In addition, the application of systemic (potassium phosphonate) with one and double injection (20 ml and 40 ml of fungicide for each injection frequency), and semi-systemic (metalaxyl) fungicide showed better control compared to contact fungicides (copper based fungicide) in both locations that were used in the experiment; Biological control: Heavy application of chemical fungicide would eventually leads to resistant of pathogen and causing soil and water pollutions. Hence, more sustainable and environmental friendly method should be established and implemented, such as biological control. Several species of fungi from the genera of Trichoderma was identified to be a beneficial endophyte, to control black pod caused by Phytophthora spp. An isolate of Trichoderma asperellum from soil was observed as a potential mycoparasite for P. megakarya where this fungus has the potential to reduce black pod incident under field condition in Cameroon. It was reported that moderate black pod cases (47%) occurred in the T. asperellum treatment to control black pod disease compared to trees with untreated (71%) and chemical fungicide (1.73%). In Brazil, a new species known as Trichoderma martiale Samuels, sp. nov. was identified as an endophyte on cocoa, which has the ability to reduce black pod symptoms cause by P. megakarya. This endophyte species survives on cocoa pods, and has the ability to establish a long endophytic association with the host (about 3.5 months). Nevertheless, the protection against black pod via biological control is not as effective as the control using chemical fungicides; Resistant variety: There is no specific variety of cocoa that shows resistant to Phytophthora infections and the establishment and utilization of resistant variety will be most likely depends on the region. Numerous breeding programs have been established worldwide in order to screen and test for local hybrids for disease resistant of Phytophthora spp. For example, a study in Cameroon assessed the performance of local cocoa cultivars (the southern and northern Cameroon cultivar) compared to the local and international gene bank cultivars. The local genebank cultivar consisted of F1 hybrid of Upper Amazon X Trinidad, and an international cultivar from Papua New Guinea, and Latin America were provided through International Cocoa Genebank, Trinidad. Based on the information provided by farmers and leaf disc test to assess resistant variety, the local cultivars selected from farmers field showed some resistant to P. megakarya compared to other varieties. Thus, it was concluded that there are some potential resistant varieties available in this area.</item>

        <item>Leaves: abnormal colors, abnormal leaf fall, necrotic areas; Roots: necreotic streaks or lesions; Stems: dieback, discoloration of bark, internal discoloration, mould growth on lesion; Whole plant: dwarfing. Infection always occurs through young flush leaves at a growing point with the fungus growing down the stem. Seedlings have only one growing point and are killed by the infection. After the jorquette is formed, the infection may progress into the main stem and kill the plant. Once trees are mature they have thousands of growing points, all of which can be infected. The disease does not progress into the larger branches of mature trees except perhaps in the most susceptible material, within which it can spread to the trunk causing the tree to die. There are no visible symptoms during initial fungal growth within the plant.</item>
        <item>Monthly inspection and pruning of infected stems has been practised both to prevent the disease from spreading within individual plants and also to lower the inoculum level. Pruning can be effective when combined with moderate levels of resistance, but it was often ineffective when inoculum levels were high and planting material was susceptible. Pruning young seedlings can result in complete recovery, but may also lead to an uneven stand.</item>

        <item>Mycosphaerella coffeicola</item>
        <item>Spots occur on leaves and berries. Plants are susceptible throughout all of their developmental stages. Brown circular leaf spots, up to 15 mm in diam., sometimes with concentric rings and a yellowish halo. The centre of spot becomes grey and dark sporulation can be seen in this area.</item>
        <item>Prevention is the most effective method of managing M. coffeicola. Risk factors for this pathogen include: prolonged (24–72 hours) humid environment, poor soil nutrition, and plant stress caused by increased planting density, herbicide injury, weeds, drought, and over irrigation. To manage humidity a farmer can prune to allow for air circulation and ensure the soil has proper drainage. In order to maintain proper plant nutrition, soil testing and a fertilization regiment are essential for combating this pathogen. Plant symptoms such as chlorosis, leaf curling, and bronzing along the edges of leaves can be used to diagnose specific nutrient deficiencies. For example if a plant has leaves bronzed along edges, cupped down-ward; new leaves dead; eventual die back of shoot tips, then it is likely the plant has a calcium deficiency. To reduce plant stress, a farmer can use herbicides to combat weeds but must be careful not to damage the plant in process. Also to minimize competition between adjacent crops, it is important to properly space coffee plants in 8 ft. by 8 ft. areas. Stress can further be minimized if post and pre-harvest damage by machinery or laborers is avoided. To avoid wilting stress plants should be properly irrigated. However, if a crop already has M. coffeicola, copper fungicide is effective. In Hawaii, farmers often spray tri-annually, using 1.5-6 lbs of fungicide per 50–100 gallons water, containing 30-80% copper hydroxide. "Sprays should coincide with dry weather and calm winds. Three spray applications per season should suffice (occurring approximately once per month), beginning at flowering. Thorough coverage of the plant canopy is very important. Large farms in Hawai‘i utilize tractor-mounted mist blowers."</item>

        <item>Hemileia vastatrix</item>
        <item>Infections occur on the coffee leaves.The first observable symptoms are small, pale yellow spots on the upper surfaces of the leaves. As these spots gradually increase in diameter, masses of orange urediniospores (= uredospores) appear on the undersurfaces. The fungus sporulates through the stomata rather than breaking through the epidermis as most rusts do, so it does not form the pustules typical of many rusts. The powdery lesions on the undersides of the leaves can be orange-yellow to red-orange in color, and there is considerable variation from one region to another. While the lesions can develop anywhere on the leaf, they tend to be concentrated around the margins, where dew and rain droplets collect. The centers of the spots eventually dry and turn brown, while the margins of the lesions continue to expand and produce urediniospores. Early in the season, the first lesions usually appear on the lowermost leaves, and the infection slowly progresses upward in the tree. The infected leaves drop prematurely, leaving long expanses of twigs devoid of leaves. The disease is recognized by the yellow-orange powdery lesions or spots on the underside of leaves</item>
        <item>Non-chemical control: Resistance varies with leaf age, particularly for susceptible varieties, with young leaves more susceptible than older leaves on the same plant. Plants with incomplete resistance, however, usually display the opposite response,with high resistance in young and low resistance in older leaves. Cultivars derived from Timor hybrid and the Icatu cultivar display this pattern. Light intensity also influences cultivar reactions. Leaves exposed to high light intensity are generally more susceptible to rust, varying up to 10 fold depending upon pre- and post-inoculation light intensity. It is an important consideration in setting up conditions for rust screening or evaluation. Overbearing coffee may exacerbate rust intensity. Additionally, leaves supporting rapidly growing coffee berries are more susceptible to infection than leaves that only support vegetative growth. High yielding coffee varieties are more susceptible than low yielding varieties. Chemical control: Fungicides to control of rust have been used successfully for a quite a number of years. The metallic copper fungicides have been the least expensive and most effective, with copper oxychloride formulations being the best. The dithiocarbamate protectant fungicides have been useful, but their short residual life and instability at higher temperatures and humidity have limited their widespread adoption. Their performance is better when mixed with copper fungicides. The systemic triazole sterol biosynthesis inhibitors have been effective, but high cost and occasional problems with severe defoliation (phytotoxicity) have been observed. Among the systemics, triademifon has been the best so far. The systemics have also been particularly effective when used in combination or alternately with copper fungicides, reducing the likelihood for the development of fungicide tolerant rust strains. Occasional problems with defoliation associated with the systemics, and their high cost, however, may limit their usefulness. Fungicide efficacy depends both on timing of application and complete placement or coverage of the toxicant. This latter factor is important, since redistribution by rain is very limited. Important factors are spray volume, droplet size, and coverage. In timing the application of fungicides, rainfall was generally the most important factor to consider. Sprays during the rainy season were recommended, and sometimes recommended before the onset of the rainy season. Studies showed that initial inoculum level and berry yield varied greatly from year to year, and it was necessary to include these factors in scheduling fungicide applications. Yield in coffee can vary from maximum to 10 percent of max yield, depending on cultivar and on the extent of defoliation and yield the previous year, due to rust. Only 2-3 fungicide applications were required during low yield years and 4-6 applications during high yield years. These schedules were developed empirically.</item>

        <item>Initial symptoms vary with the host. On Hevea, the initial stages of infection are seen as drops of latex and a silky-white mycelial growth on the surface of brown bark. In Piper, sterile pink/white pustules of around 1 mm diameter appear on the young green stems. In Citrus, the sterile pustules may appear first, sometimes with gummosis. In Theobroma, infection is usually first seen as a sparse white mycelium (web) on the bark surface. The surface mycelium is easily overlooked, particularly where the bark is wet. The mycelium spreads mainly along the underside of the branch and sterile pink/white mycelial pustules appear through cracks in the bark and through the pores of the swollen lenticels, about 1-8 cm behind the leading edge of the infection. Hyphae penetrate the branch, causing progressive death of distal tissues. Leaves distal to the infection turn light green in the interveinal areas and then scorch brown from the margins. The affected leaves remain attached to the plant for a long time, giving an appearance similar to that of a broken branch. The characteristic pink/white or pink/orange basidiomatal encrustation develops mostly towards the underside of the branch, although it can develop around the entire circumference of the stem; it can reach 2 m in length. The crust is initially smooth, but cracks and becomes paler as it ages. Conidia are sometimes produced, on orange/red pustules scattered over the bark surface. Long black streaks of coagulated latex or gums appear on infected branches of Hevea or Theobroma, and open wounds develop as the bark cankers and splits.</item>
        <item>Management of P. salmonicolor and Pink Disease can be very difficult given its wide host range, making cross-infection a concern. Cultural control can be implemented by pruning frequently and burning any infected branches removed. This is effective when the disease can be recognized in the earliest stages, but it is most effective when performed concurrently with fungicide application. The encrustation and conidial pustules are able to remain functional for a period of time after the infected branches have been removed from the tree. Fungicide use varies among countries affected by the disease. In India, pre- and post-monsoon application of fungicides directly on the trunk and branches of cocoa or rubber trees effectively prevented the disease, while application of a sulphur-lime slurry to tea shrubs worked best in Kalimantan in Borneo, and Validamycin A was found to be the most effective means of control on rubber trees in Vietnam. The use of fungicides prevents the basidiospores from germinating and causing infection.</item>
