        <item>Gross feeding damage to foliage, growing points, and young stems. Severe infestation results in total defoliation or destruction of the plant to ground level. Eggs: Pale-yellowish and becomes dark brown just before hatching. The black head-capsules of the larvae can be seen through the shells. Each egg is about 0.5 mm in diameter, conical with a slightly rounded apex and a densely sculpted surface; Larvae: Develops from grey-green with white-yellow stripes down its back when small, to black with thin blue lines down the middle of the back and yellow-green lines outside the blue lines when fully grown. It measures 2 to 3cm long, has a velvety-black upper surface with pale lateral lines, a green or yellow ventral surface, and no hairs on the body. There are three parallel lines on the dorsal surface of the prothoracic (first body) segment and a stripe running longitudinally down the mid-dorsal surface of the body is always paler than the black pigmentation on either side of it. The head is always shiny-black; Pupa: Mahogany-brown, 10-14mm long, with a smooth, shiny surface; Adult: It is 14-18mm long and has a 29-32mm wing span. The abdomen is covered with pale grey-brown scales (except for the tip in the female which has black hair-scales). Forewings are dark-brown with distinctive grey-black markings. Hindwings are white with dark veins.</item>
        <item>Many animals, birds and insects prey on the African armyworm at different stages of its life cycle. These natural enemies should be encouraged by maintaining natural surroundings with plenty of breeding places for them, including trees and shrubs. Night birds and bats feed on the African armyworm moths, and lacewings, wasps, parasitic wasps and spiders eat the caterpillars; Avoid burning and overgrazing of grasslands which are the natural habitat and food store of the caterpillars. Burning often causes outbreaks because as soon as temperatures rise, eggs are laid in large quantities on the fresh new grass.</item>

        <item>Cnaphalocrocis medinalis (Guenée)</item>
        <item>The first sign of leaffolder infestation is the presence of moths in the field. Longitudinal and transparent whitish streaks on damaged leaves, tubular folded leaves, and leaf tips sometimes fastened to the basal part of leaf are caused by larvae feeding. Severely damaged plants appear burned with many folded leaves. Under heavy attack, a field will appear gray white from a distance. Eggs: Translucent, yellowish white, oval, 0.90 mm long and 0.39 mm wide, and almost flat with a slightly convex surface; Larva: Young larvae are translucent but turn yellowish green as they mature, head capsules and thoraxes are brown, have one pair of dark spots on the abdomen near the head; Pupa: Light brown, but turns reddish brown toward moth emergence; Adult: 10-12mm long and has wing span of 13-15mm; light brown with shiny, brownish yellow wings adorned with dark, broad margins, and two to three dark vertical stripes; appears triangular when at rest.</item>
        <item>Careful use of nitrogenous fertilizer in split applications is recommended. Removal of grassy weeds from rice fields and surrounding borders prevents the buildup of rice leaffolders on alternate hosts. However, chemical control is the only practical method to control increasing leaffolder infestation during crop growth. Numerous insecticides that have been identified for control are most effective as foliar sprays. But foliar sprays have to be repeated because they are often washed off by frequent rains. Granular insecticides broadcast into water are ineffective. Since leaffolders can attack the crop during any growth stage, fields should be monitored weekly.</item>

        <item>Banana Aphids</item>
        <item>Pentalonia nigronervosa</item>
        <item>Like most aphids, the banana aphid is a phloem feeder that uses its long stylets to pierce plant tissues to suck the sap directly from the vessels. This can cause plants to become deformed; the leaves become curled and shriveled, and in some cases galls are formed on the leaves. Nymphs: Like most other aphid species, the banana aphid has four nymphal stages. Newborn nymphs are oval at first and become slightly elongated. They are reddish brown, with four segmented antennae, and measure 1/250 inch in length. The second stage nymphs are similar in appearance and measure approximately 7/250 inch long. The third nymphal stage individuals are light brown, measuring about 9/250 inch in length; the compound eyes are more noticeable beginning with this stage, and the nymphs have five-segmented antennae. The fourth stage nymphs have six-segmented antennae, are light brown in color, and are 1/25 inch long. The first, second, third, and fourth nymphal stages last 2 to 4, 3 to 4, 2 to 4, and 2 to 4 days, respectively. Adults: Adult banana aphids are small to medium sized aphids (1/25 to 1/12 inch), shiny, reddish to dark brown or almost black. They have six-segmented antennae that are as long as the body. Alates have prominent, dark (brown or black) wing veins. Adults start producing young one day after reaching maturity. They can give birth to 4 aphids per day with an average production of 14 offspring per female.</item>
        <item>Aphids can be killed by their natural enemies, or with sprays of registered insecticides, or with insecticidal soaps or liquid dish washing detergents and vegetable oils. Ants protect the aphids from their enemies, and ants feed upon the sweet honeydew that aphids produce. Control tips: (1) Inspect alternate hosts for aphids - eliminate populations of banana aphids that are living on non-banana hosts within the vicinity of your bananas; (2) Inspect banana plants for aphids - scout banana plants at least twice per month for aphid colonies; (3) Control ants - control ants if possible and lawful, ants aggressively protect aphids from natural enemies; (4) Invite beneficial animals and insects - strive to foster a conducive environment for beneficial, aphid-feeding or -parasitizing insects such as lady beetles; (5) Destroy wild bananas in the area - eliminate wild of unattended patches of bananas, large populations of banana aphids can grow on them and the wild patches when infected can serve as a serious and constant source of disease for farms and residential neighborhoods; (6) Control weeds around bananas - maintain good weed control around the banana patch; (7) Diversify the banana farm - grow a range of different plants or crops; (8) Prune the mats - keep banana mats pruned of all unwanted suckers; (9) Spray for aphid control.</item>

        <item>Stephanitis typicus</item>
        <item>Leaves have abnormal colours, abnormal leaf fall, internal feeding, necrotic areas, and wilting. Adult lace bugs have beautifully sculptured wings that resemble an intricate, lacy network. There are also lacy extensions at each side on the front part of the body and an expanded, lacy hood that extends over the head. Some species are almost entirely white while others are marked with black or brown. They range in size from 1/8 to 3/16 inch. Nymphs do not have wings but usually have spines on the back.</item>
        <item>To manage lace bugs, remove leaflets harboring the insects and destroy them. For chemical method, spraying one these can help: Malathion 50 EC @ 2 ml/lt, Dimethoate 30 EC @1 ml/lt, Methyl demeton 25 EC @1 ml/lt, Phosphamidon 40 SL @1.25 ml/lt, Monocrotophos 36 WSC @1 ml/lt, Methomyl 25 EC @2 ml/lit, 3% Neem oil.</item>

        <item>Chrysomphalus aonidium Hemiberlesia lataneae</item>
        <item>Whether armored or soft, scale insects are often found on the undersides of leaves or on branches. Each species of scale has specific plants they are associated with. The scale blends in well, so the actual insect may not be very apparent. When scales feed underneath the leaves, yellow spots often appear on the tops of the foliage. Over time, the plant can become more chlorotic-looking, and new plant growth can be stunted. And if you’re dealing with soft scale, another symptom is the appearance of sooty mold. (Be aware, however, that sooty mold can also be caused by whiteflies and aphids.) Scale insects vary dramatically in appearance; from very small organisms (1–2 mm) that grow beneath wax covers (some shaped like oyster shells, others like mussel shells), to shiny pearl-like objects (about 5 mm), to creatures covered with mealy wax. Adult female scales are almost always immobile (aside from mealybugs) and permanently attached to the plant they have parasitized. They secrete a waxycoating for defense; this coating causes them to resemble reptilian scales or fish scales, hence their common name.</item>
        <item>To get rid of scale insects prune and dispose of infested branches, twigs and leaves. When scale numbers are low they may be rubbed or picked off of plants by hand. Dabbing individual pests with an alcohol-soaked cotton swab or neem-based leaf shine will also work when infestations are light. Commercially available beneficial insects, such as ladybugs and lacewing, are natural predators of the young larval or “crawler” stage. Organic pesticides, like insecticidal soap and d-Limonene can also be used to kill the larvae. However, these products have very little persistence in the environment, so several applications during egg-hatching will be required for effective control. Azamax contains azadirachtin, the key insecticidal ingredient found in neem oil. This concentrated spray is approved for organic use and offers multiple modes of action, making it virtually impossible for pest resistance to develop. Best of all, it’s non-toxic to honey bees and many other beneficial insects. Horticultural oils and other safe, oil-based insecticides work by smothering insects and will control all pest stages, including adults which are protected from most other insecticides by their armor coverings. Fast-acting botanical insecticides should be used as a last resort. Derived from plants which have insecticidal properties, these natural pesticides have fewer harmful side effects than synthetic chemicals and break down more quickly in the environment.</item>

        <item>Due to their small sizes and high rates of reproduction, thrips are difficult to control using classical biological control. All predators must be small and slender enough to penetrate the crevices where thrips hide while feeding, and then prey extensively on eggs and larvae. Only two families of parasitoid Hymenoptera are known to parasitize eggs and larvae, the Eulophidae and the Trichogrammatidae. Other biocontrol agents of adults and larvae include aphid wasps, anthocorid bugs of genus Orius, and phytoseiid mites. For this reason, many growers are occasionally forced to make limited use of pesticides to control thrips populations in the field and in greenhouses. Another effective strategy for pest thrips are biological insecticides, including Beauveria bassiana or Verticillium lecanii. These demonstrate a clear effect on eggs, larvae and adults of thrips. Insecticidal soap spray is effective against thrips. It is commercially available or can be made of certain types of household soap. Scientists in Japan report that significant reductions in larva and adult melon thripes occur when plants are illuminated with red light.</item>

        <item>Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae</item>
        <item>Symptoms appear first as water-soaked stripes at the margin of fully developed leaves. Lesions enlarge both in length and width. Margins are wavy and turn light brown in a few days. Regions adjoining the healthy part has a water-soaked appearance. Lesions may start at one or both edges of the leaves and as the disease advances, the lesions cover the entire blade, turn grayish, and later white. Appearance of milky or ”opaque dew drops” on the surface of young lesions in the morning is a sign of bacterial blight infection. The milky dew drops dry to form small, amber-colored beads and these spheres are the ooze of the bacterial mass. Infection at seedling stage develop “Kresek” or wilting of whole leaves or the entire plant. It causes wilting of seedlings and yellowing and drying of leaves.</item>
        <item>Use of resistant varieties together with modified cultural practices to disrupt the disease cycle and proper deployment of resistant varieties in the field. Use balanced amounts of plant nutrients, especially nitrogen. Keep fields clean. Remove weed hosts and plow under rice stubble, straw, rice ratoons and volunteer seedlings, which can serve as hosts of bacteria.</item>

        <item>Infected plants show browning and drying of leaves. Initially appear as small, water-soaked, linear lesions between leaf veins. These streaks are initially dark green and later become light brown to yellowish gray. The lesions are translucent when held against the light. Entire leaves may become brown and die when the disease is very severe. Infected plants show browning and drying of leaves. Under severe conditions, this could lead to reduced grain weight due to loss of photosynthetic area.</item>

        <item>Puccinia polysora</item>
        <item>Surfaces of leaf blades, leaf sheaths and stalks exhibit brown, circular, powdery pustules. Leaves which are severely infected dries up and defoliates prematurely. Those of southern rust are circular to oval, light cinnamon-brown to orange in color and predominantly on the upper-leaf surface. Pustules tend to occur only sparsely on the leaf underside, but may occur abundantly on the leaf sheath. Haloes can be observed in some hybrids around pustules when leaves are backlit. The pustules are usually more densely clustered than those of common rust. And, like common rust, the pustules can darken in color later in the season as the spore type changes. Common corn rust, caused by the fungus Puccinia sorghi, is the most frequently occurring of the two primary rust diseases of corn in the U.S., but it rarely causes significant yield losses in Ohio field (dent) corn. Occasionally field corn, particularly in the southern half of the state, does become severely affected when weather conditions favor the development and spread of the rust fungus. Sweet corn is generally more susceptible than field corn. In years with exceptionally cool summers, and especially on late-planted fields or sweet corn, yield losses may occur when the leaves at and above the ears become severely diseased before grain fill is complete.</item>
        <item>Plow deep to bury scleotia. Some producers avoid disease or minimize its effects by not planting late or by using shorter season hybrids. By doing so, they have a more mature and resistant crop in the field when rust spores arrive and sometimes disease can be completely avoided.</item>
